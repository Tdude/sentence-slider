# Sentence Slider Readme

## To use this text slider in a hurry

This is a Wordpress plugin installed via the normal WP plugins install page.
Go to the new "Sentence Slider" menu in your WordPress admin.
Add your sentences.
Use the shortcode [sentence_slider] anywhere you want in your posts and pages to display the slider.

## Features

Simple admin interface to add/remove sentences.
Transition between sentences with a few styles interchangeable.
Fairly responsive for mobiles.
5-sec rotation interval as default but can be changed.
Shortcode for placement anywhere in your WP content.
Fully translatable. En and SE as default.

## To customize

Adjust the timing in seconds.
Modify the styles of slider, from swooshy styles to calmer.
For longer sentences you may have to adjust the CSS height. You could also easily add a field to get a title/text kinda style.
You may also copy the PHP to your theme's functions.php, where you also load the js/css. However, if you do so, you're on your own.

## Why
Maja was grumpy and couldn't understand why things "won't work" in Wordpress. We couldn't find a simple slider plugin, just bloated ones.
This plugin was created in a couple of hours based on a dusty template for plugins I did some time ago.

## Challenges
Language files, mo, po, no, p√• (as I misspelled it once), were not my forte. I spent half the next day trying to get a grasp. Got it, woohoo!
